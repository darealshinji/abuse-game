fRaBs!
------

This is basically registered Abuse, with slight modifications 
and removal of material that might not be public domain. Abuse
is a side-scrolling action game made by the now-defunct 
Crack dot Com. It's an excellent single and multi-player game,
with a superb level editor and a unique control system.

NEWS
----

* 2 March 2008: fRaBs 2.11 was released. Minor bugfixes allow all
games to work properly with Abuse-SDL.

-----
NOTES
-----

* Satan Paint, the artwork editor for Abuse, is included in 
fRaBs, along with the generic DOS4GW. Check the /art folder.

* Thanks for all your support and comments folks, I'm glad 
you all are still interested in the reigning king of action
side-scrolling games. Rock on!

* Claudio's addon enhances this version of Abuse with many new 
enemies and objects. Aliens Abuse objects and art are also
included. However, do not try to run the original versions of
these addons with fRaBs, as these versions have had significant
and necessary changes so that they work more smoothly with Abuse.
Just trust me... you'll be fine with what you have. :)

* I hope to include the updates of the Twisted Minds addon whenever
the creator, Profound, releases them. This addon allows you to 
ride vehicles and also has a twisted set of Super Mario Bros. art
and graphics. Read the readme in /addon/twist for more information,
and to use the whole Twisted Minds object set, be sure to run the 
proper batch file, as not all of these objects are included when you
normally run fRaBs. The object menu would get really crazy if they
were included. 

* Before running this, make sure you run SETUP.EXE and configure
settings for your soundcard. Next, check the gamma settings by 
running Abuse and clicking the darkest visible color on the 
Gamma control button (Monitor w/ RGB).

* Remember that because most of /music is deleted, you will not 
hear music in the game, so there's no point in trying to configure 
it in SETUP.EXE. It might not work anyways. :)

* By using these commands, you can play levels from the command-line.
You can either do this from a DOS window or by making a shortcut
or by using the RUN command from the Start menu in Windows.

abuse.exe -f blahblah.spe
abuse.exe -f levels/blahblah.spe

* To use Abuse's powerful level editor, use this command.

abuse.exe -edit
abuse.exe -edit -f whatever.lvl

* A detailed HTML readme is found in /docs.
