Requirements for Compiling
--------------------------
- SDL 1.1.6 <http://www.libsdl.org>
- X11R6(or above) and libraries.
- Linux kernel 2.2 or above.
- GL libraries and headers are required for OpenGL support.


Compiling
---------

1. Untar the abuse_sdl-x.x.tar.gz file.

     tar -zxf abuse_sdl-x.x.tar.gz

   This will create an abuse_sdl-x.x directory with the source in it.

2. Run  './configure'
   This will create the Makefiles required to build Abuse-SDL.

   If you wish to specify a location for the datafiles instead of using the
   default of '/usr/local/share/games/abuse', you can do so by passing the
   following argument to the configure script:

     --datafir=<location>

   where <location> is the directory where the datafiles will be installed.

3. Run  'make'
   This will start the build.

4. Run 'make install'
   This will install Abuse-SDL.


MacOSX
------
A Project Builder project is included in the 'osx' directory and can be used
if desired.  Using project Builder is currently the only way to get OpenGL
support compiled in.


If anything goes wrong please contact me at <trandor@labyrinth.net.au> with
the details, and I'll try and sort it out.

Good luck,
