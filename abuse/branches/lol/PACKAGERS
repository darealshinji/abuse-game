Notes for Abuse packagers
-------------------------

1.) Non-free data

By default Abuse tarballs ship with all available data. This is for simplicity
but may pose problems to distributions that only ship free data. You can easily
create a stripped down tarball which has all the non-free data removed:

    ./configure --disable-nonfree
    make dist


2.) Assets directory

The default assets directory is ${datadir}/games/abuse. With the default prefix
value, this expands to /usr/local/share/games/abuse.

To override the assets directory, use the `--with-assetdir' configure flag,
for instance:

    ./configure --with-assetdir=/opt/abuse
