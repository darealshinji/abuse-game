Abuse and related source code for the Win32 port.  March 4, 2001

This code represents the current state of the Win32 port.
You'll need MS VC6 to compile it; make sure you update your include
directories to point to the various places where the .h files are
located.

The Abuse32 code has been by far the most worked on, and differs
the most from the original Abuse-pd release.  Almost every file has
been reformatted to reflect my coding style (because VC can do it
automagically and it makes it easier for me to read), although
for the most part the actual code hasn't changed.

Good luck with it; I'll be happy to answer any questions about it,
so long as they're code-related and not things like "How do I get
this to compile?" or other IDE-related questions.
