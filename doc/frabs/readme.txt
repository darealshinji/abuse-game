fRaBs!
------

This is basically registered Abuse, with slight modifications
and removal of material that might not be public domain. Abuse
is a side-scrolling action game made by the now-defunct
Crack dot Com. It's an excellent single and multi-player game,
with a superb level editor and a unique control system.

NEWS

* 2 March 2008: fRaBs 2.11 was released. Minor bugfixes allow all
games to work properly with Abuse-SDL.

NOTES
-----

* Thanks for all your support and comments folks, I'm glad
you all are still interested in the reigning king of action
side-scrolling games. Rock on!

* Claudio's addon enhances this version of Abuse with many new
enemies and objects. Aliens Abuse objects and art are also
included. However, do not try to run the original versions of
these addons with fRaBs, as these versions have had significant
and necessary changes so that they work more smoothly with Abuse.
Just trust me... you'll be fine with what you have. :)

* I hope to include the updates of the Twisted Minds addon whenever
the creator, Profound, releases them. This addon allows you to
ride vehicles and also has a twisted set of Super Mario Bros. art
and graphics. Read the readme in /addon/twist for more information,
and to use the whole Twisted Minds object set, be sure to run the
proper batch file, as not all of these objects are included when you
normally run fRaBs. The object menu would get really crazy if they
were included.

* By using these commands, you can play levels from the command-line.
You can either do this from a command window or by making a shortcut
or by using the RUN command from the Start menu in Windows.

  abuse -f blahblah.spe
  abuse -f levels/blahblah.spe

* To use Abuse's powerful level editor, use this command.

  abuse -edit
  abuse -edit -f whatever.lvl

* A detailed HTML readme is found in /doc/frabs.
