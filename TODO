This is a list of known bugs and features that need fixing/implementing:

BUGS
----
- On some systems, Abuse-SDL crashes during startup due to a NULL object.
   (This is because of corrupt datafiles)

  error. (See the README file for details on how to workaround this)

--------
- Multiplayer support over the internet and local network using tcp/ip.
- Multiplayer support over a local network using IPX.
- Performance improvements.
- Add YUV overlay support.

SAM'S TODO
----------
 - replace write_PCX calls with SDL_WriteSurfaceBMP
 - is visobj.cpp really used?

ABUSE-TOOL
----------
 - segfault with "abuse-tool foo.spe put 1 2" (missing argument)
 - add an option to display an md5sum or something
 - allow to query ids by name rather than by number

DATA MERGE
----------
 - remove registration related code
   - server check in src/net/netdrv.cp
   - server check in src/innet.cpp
