;;(setf player1 'joystick)


;; note : this function is called by the game when it collects input from
;; the local player (the machine you are playing on in net games)
;; because it is only executed locally it should not change any global varible
;; Also the rest of the game should not use any input gathering routines such as
;; joy_stat & key_presed.

;;  The returned input from this routine is passed on to the server where it is
;; distributed to other clients.
;; The format for return is '(xv yv B1 B2 B3 mx my)

;; xv = movement left right (-1=left, 0=none, 1=right)
;; yv = movement up and down (-1=up,  0=none, 1=right)
;; B1 = using special power (T or nil)
;; B2 = firing button (T or nil)
;; B3 = toggle to weapons (-1 toggle weapons to the left, 0=no toggle, 1 toggle to the right)
;; mx = mouse x position on the screen
;; my = mouse y position on the screen

;; other possible key names for get_key_code include :
;;   "Up_Arrow","Down_Arrow","Left_Arrow","Right_Arrow",
;;   "Left_Ctrl","Right_Ctrl","Left_Alt","Right_Alt",
;;   "Left_Shift","Right_Shift","Caps_Lock","Num_Lock",
;;   "Home","End","Del","F1","F2","F3","F4","F5","F6",
;;   "F7","F8","F9","F10","Insert"
;;   "a", "b", "c", ...
;; though not all of these keys will work on all operating systems


;; note : at this current time weapon toggle input is ignored and
;; CTRL & INS are used... sorry :)  These have to be event based,
;; not polled so no key pressed are missed.
